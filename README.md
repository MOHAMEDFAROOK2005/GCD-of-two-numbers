# Find the GCD of two numbers

## AIM:
To write a program to find the GCD of two numbers using function.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner

## Algorithm
1. Define a function.
2. Get the two numbers from the user.
3. Compare the two values, to find the smaller number.
4. Use for() and if() loop to find the GCD of the two numbers.

## Program:
```
/*
#Program to find the distance between two points.
#Developed by: MOHAMED FAROOK S
#RegisterNumber:23014058
import math 
x1,y1=10,6
x2,y2=4,2
d=math.sqrt((x2-x1)**2+(y2-y1)**2)
print("{:.2f}".format(d)) 
*/
```

## Output:

## Result:
Thus the program to find the GCD of two numbers is written and verified using python programming.
